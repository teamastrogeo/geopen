## Development Setup

### Required Tools
- STM32CubeIDE or nRF Connect SDK
- KiCad or Altium Designer (for PCB design)
- 3D CAD software (Fusion 360, SolidWorks)
- Oscilloscope, multimeter, logic analyzer

### Getting Started

1. Review `docs/design/hardware-design.md` for specifications
2. Set up development environment
3. Review component datasheets in `datasheets/`
4. Start with firmware proof-of-concept
