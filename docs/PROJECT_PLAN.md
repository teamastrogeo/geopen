## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **Sensor Accuracy**: May not achieve ±2-3° target
   - *Mitigation*: Extensive sensor testing, algorithm refinement
2. **Form Factor**: May not fit all components in pencil form
   - *Mitigation*: Early prototyping, component optimization
3. **Battery Life**: May not achieve 8+ hours
   - *Mitigation*: Power optimization, efficient algorithms

### Market Risks
1. **Competition**: Existing tools may improve
   - *Mitigation*: Focus on unique form factor and cost
2. **Adoption**: Users may prefer existing tools
   - *Mitigation*: User research, beta testing, training

### Schedule Risks
1. **Delays**: Development may take longer
   - *Mitigation*: Buffer time, agile development
2. **Manufacturing**: Production delays
   - *Mitigation*: Early supplier engagement

## Success Criteria

### Technical
